<!-- # 🎭 Real-Time Face Emotion Detector

An AI-powered application that detects human faces and identifies emotions (Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, etc.) in real-time using your webcam.

## 🧠 How It Works
1. **Vision:** Uses **OpenCV** to access the webcam and detect faces using Haar Cascades.
2. **Intelligence:** Uses **DeepFace** (a Deep Learning library) to analyze facial features.
3. **Output:** Overlays the dominant emotion on the video feed instantly.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.11**
- **OpenCV** (Computer Vision)
- **DeepFace** (Face Analysis)
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (Backend)
